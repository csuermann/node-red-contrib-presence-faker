# Presence Faker

Node that fakes presence in a smart home by switching devices (e.g. lights) on and off at random times.

You can configure a time window during which the node should eject random ON / OFF messages (e.g. 07:00 - 14:30), the duration of ON times (min / max) as well as how many ON times (min / max) should be randomly scheduled.
